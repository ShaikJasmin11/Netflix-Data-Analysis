## Dataset Info

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Netflix Titles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)  
- **Rows:** 8,800+  
- **Fields:** `title`, `type`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `genres`

---

## Key Analysis Questions

- What is the breakdown between Movies and TV Shows?
- Which years saw the highest number of titles added?
- What are the most featured genres on Netflix?
- How has content changed over time?

---

## Visualizations

- **Bar Chart** – Top 10 Most Common Genres

## About Me

I'm a data enthusiast with a love for clean visuals, smart insights, and asking the right questions. I approach every dataset like a detective — curious, critical, and committed to telling the story behind the numbers. I'm excited to bring this mindset to Labmentix and learn from real-world analytics challenges.
